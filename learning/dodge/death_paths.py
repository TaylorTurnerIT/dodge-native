"""Record every pattern appearance in a block of games, for the death-path viewer.

A frozen policy plays a block of fixed seeds with the engine's gameplay trace
on (Taylor Turner's recorder, `dodge_native` `lane_trace`). When a game ends,
by death or by the frame cap, its trace gives every pattern appearance in it:
the pattern, when it started and ended, the player's path through it, its
rectangles, and how it ended. A death outside any pattern becomes an
appearance of "no pattern" (pid -1) holding the last frames before it.

Every decision each game took is kept, so any appearance can be replayed
(`dodge.pattern_replay`).
